## Overview
I spent this quarter working on Wellbot, a Discord bot for facilitating peer mental health and emotional support.

Here's the quick rundown:
### Problem
- Struggling with mental health issues can be lonely
- Finding people who have gone through similar experiences can help 
- It can be scary and anxiety-inducing to reach out
- People donâ€™t always ask for help

### What Wellbot Can Do
I'm aware that there are many Discord bots out there and I don't claim that my bot is superior or is _the_ solution that is going to solve all mental health problems. Especially since this is a solo project I has ten weeks to ideate, design, build, and test, this is very much a prototype!
- Discord bot that can be added to servers of friends, strangers, or a mix of both
- Lets people anonymously indicate to their peers that they are looking for mental health support
- Others can offer help to these requests
- Once help is offered to a request, Wellbot offers a safe and private space for the requester and offerer to chat

## Process
Here's a rough breakdown for the process and how long I spent on each step.
